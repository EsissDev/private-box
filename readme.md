# Private Box
A tool for creating your own worlds using the box critters engine.

## instructions from after rework (not well formatted)
requires https
either setup https on your server or host somewhere else like heroku

if you setup https please tell me how you did it because i keep getting ssl errors

port config is in index.js
run with node.js

on client script, set ip and nickname to your liking
run client connect script in console on boxcritters
